# Development

## Building and running this extension

```term
gh repo clone fastly/vscode-fastly-vcl
cd vscode-fastly-vcl
npm i
```

## What's in the folder

- `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your language support and define the location of the grammar file that has been copied into your extension.
- `syntaxes/vcl.tmLanguage.json` - this is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization.
- `language-configuration.json` - this is the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for comments and brackets.
- `client/` - this is the Language Server Protocol client that talks to the LSP server ([`fastly-vcl-lsp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastly-vcl-lsp)).
